Welcome to the NeuroCave 3D brain visualization tool demo! This tool provides a unique
and interactive way to explore brain regions and their connectivity.
Let's take a look at some of the features:

Independent glyph size control for left and right view windows -
this feature allows users to adjust the size of the glyphs (cubes and spheres)
independently for the left and right view windows. This is particularly useful
when comparing brain regions or when focusing on a specific hemisphere.

Independent sphere and cube glyph control - users can choose to represent brain
regions as cubes or spheres depending on their preference. This feature can help
highlight different aspects of brain regions and their connections.

Independent control of ipsilateral and contralateral connectivity edge display
toggle and threshold - the tool allows users to control the visibility of ipsilateral
and contralateral connectivity edges separately. Users can also set a threshold for
edge display, allowing them to focus on the most significant connections.

Independent control of region color visibility for left and right view window -
users can set the visibility of brain region colors separately for the left and
right view windows. This allows them to highlight specific brain regions and their connectivity.

Search bar to search for brain region of interest and display its connections -
the search bar feature allows users to search for a specific brain region of interest
and display its connections. This feature can help users focus on specific brain regions
and their connectivity.

Animation amplitude and frequency control for pulsing and flashing of selected and connected
nodes - the tool provides animation control features, allowing users to adjust the amplitude
and frequency of pulsing and flashing for selected and connected nodes. This can help highlight
important brain regions and their connections.

Overall, the NeuroCave 3D brain visualization tool provides a comprehensive and interactive way
to explore brain regions and their connectivity.
