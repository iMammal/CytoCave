Welcome to the NeuroCave 3D brain visualization tool demo! This tool provides a 
unique and interactive way to explore brain regions and their connectivity. Let's 
take a look at some of the features:

Independent glyph size control for left and right view windows - this feature allows 
users to adjust the size of the glyphs (cubes and spheres) independently for the left 
and right view windows. This is particularly useful when comparing brain regions or 
when focusing on a specific hemisphere.

Independent sphere and cube glyph control - users can choose to represent brain regions 
as cubes or spheres depending on their preference. This feature can help highlight 
different aspects of brain regions and their connections.

Independent control of ipsilateral and contralateral connectivity edge display 
toggle and threshold - the tool allows users to control the visibility of ipsilateral 
and contralateral connectivity edges separately. Users can also set a threshold for 
edge display, allowing them to focus on the most significant connections.

Independent control of region color visibility for left and right view window - 
users can set the visibility of brain region colors separately for the left and 
right view windows. This allows them to highlight specific brain regions and their 
connectivity.

Search bar to search for brain region of interest and display its connections - the 
search bar feature allows users to search for a specific brain region of interest 
and display its connections. This feature can help users focus on specific brain 
regions and their connectivity.

Animation amplitude and frequency control for pulsing and flashing of selected and 
connected nodes - the tool provides animation control features, allowing users to adjust the amplitude and frequency of pulsing and flashing for selected and connected nodes. This can help highlight important brain regions and their connections.

Overall, the NeuroCave 3D brain visualization tool provides a comprehensive and 
interactive way to explore brain regions and their connectivity.

The original NeuroCave connectomics visualization tool provided a powerful means of 
exploring brain connectome data with its 3D representation of brain regions as spheres 
and their connections as edges. Building on this foundation, the NeuroCave can be 
extended to visualize neurogenomic datasets by incorporating additional features 
such as independent glyph size control, side-by-side window display, and independent 
color coding. 

1. Independent sphere and box glyph size control sliders allow the adjustment for the point density difference between the two datasets.

2.  The side by side windows can display different colorings of the data visualization for comparison or different datasets such as brain connectome on one side and gene network on the other.

3. For viewing different datasets in the two windows, the decoupled left and right glyph size sliders allow adjustment for scale differences between the two dataset components.

4. The decoupled color coding for the two windows allows comparison of different color codings of the same dataset. For example in the brain, Anatomical regions are color coded on the left and connection degree range is color coded on the right to study connectivity degree fluctuations across various brain anatomical regions.
   The search bar can be used to locate a specific brain region or gene of interest, and its connections or correlated regions can be highlighted in the visualization.

5. Animation controls can be used to highlight a specific gene or brain region and its connections by pulsing or flashing its sphere and edges, allowing for easy identification and visualization of important genes or brain regions.

6. The ipsilateral and contralateral connectivity edge display toggle and threshold can be adjusted to explore the connectivity pattern between brain regions and genes. For example, the threshold can be set to display only the strongest connections between brain regions and genes, or to explore the overall connectivity pattern within the dataset.

Overall, the Neurocave 3D brain visualization tool provides a powerful platform to explore and analyze complex neurogenomic datasets by visualizing brain regions and genes in 3D space and allowing for easy comparison and exploration of different datasets and color codings. The decoupled control of glyph size, color coding, and connectivity edge display toggle provide users with the ability to customize the visualization to their specific research needs.

Add a bulletpoint about how large scale single cell omics studies can be visualized in the same way but with a 3D tSNE embedding of the cells instead of the brain samples.
Large-scale single-cell omics studies can also be visualized in the same way, by using a 3D tSNE embedding of the cells instead of the brain samples. The cells can be represented as spheres and grouped based on their gene expression profile, allowing for the exploration of gene expression patterns and cell types within the dataset. The independent glyph control and color coding can be used to compare and contrast different aspects of the single-cell data across different regions of the 3D embedding.

add a bulletpoint about how the 3d platonic solid based representation of clustering data can  be used to explore the heirarchical clustering of cell relationships, neuronal circuits, or gene networks.
The 3D platonic solid based representation of clustering data can be used to explore the hierarchical clustering of cell relationships, neuronal circuits, or gene networks. The nodes in the network can be represented by spheres and the edges can be represented by lines connecting the nodes. The size and color of the spheres can be used to represent different features of the data such as gene expression levels or cell type. The edges can also be color coded to represent different types of connections or interactions between nodes. This type of visualization allows for easy exploration of complex network structures and relationships.

These new features enable the visualization and comparison of two
different datasets, such as brain connectome and gene network data, providing
insights into how these two datasets interact and influence each other. 
NeuroCave can also be used to visualize large-scale single-cell omics data by
replacing brain samples with cell embeddings in a 3D tSNE space, while the 3D
platonic solid-based representation of clustering data can provide a means of
exploring the hierarchical clustering of cell relationships, neuronal circuits, or
gene networks.
