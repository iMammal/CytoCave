CytoCave is an immersive interactive online visualization platform
based on the NeuroCave [4] connectome visualization application,
but modified and optimized for general -omics network visualization.
CytoCave leverages existing features of NeuroCave— including the
side-by-side viewports designed for freeform exploration of node-
link diagrams under various transformations or coordinate system
embeddings, as well its immersive capabilities— while adding a
range of new features that facilitate the exploration of general multi-
omics network data using dimensionality reduction projection of
high-dimensional biological data with cluster membership highlighting, 
as well as scalability upgrades to support visualizing and interacting 
with large scale proteomics and multi-omics data.

CytoCave is a work in progress, this prototype was developed for the IEEE 2023 Bio+MedVis Challenge. (http://biovis.net/2023/biovisChallenges_vis).
